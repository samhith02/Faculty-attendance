body: Styles the body of the page, setting the font family, background image, size, position, margin, and padding.
.banner: Styles a banner div, setting its background color, text color, padding, and alignment.
ul: Styles an unordered list, removing default list styling, setting margin and padding to 0, and aligning text to the center.
li: Styles list items within the unordered list, making them display inline-block, setting margin, background color, padding, border radius, and a subtle box shadow.
a: Styles anchor links within list items, removing underline, setting text color, and adding a hover effect to change text color on hover.
<body>: This section contains the main content of the web page.

.banner: Creates a banner div with the title "HOME PAGE."
<ul>: Creates an unordered list of navigation items.
<li>: Creates list items for each navigation item.
<a>: Creates anchor links within list items, linking to specific sections of the page using IDs (#Profile, #Apply Leave, etc.).
